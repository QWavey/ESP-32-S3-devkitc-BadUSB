# ESPGuard

A proof-of-concept BadUSB project using the ESP32-S3 DevKitC. Demonstrates HID (Human Interface Device) emulation, keystroke injection, and custom payload deployment for security research, red teaming, and penetration testing.
This project provides a web-based control panel for the ESP32-S3 BadUSB.  
It allows uploading, editing, and executing BadUSB scripts directly from a browser over WiFi.

Board: ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 (N16R8)
SD Card Interface: SPI

## üóÇÔ∏è Planned File Structure

- `index.html` ‚Üí main frontend (UI for writing & executing scripts)
- `syntaxes.json` ‚Üí list of all available commands (`STRING`, `DELAY`, `REPEAT`, etc.) with description + examples
- `main.cpp` (firmware) ‚Üí ESP32 BadUSB logic
- `README.md` ‚Üí project documentation (this file)

---

## üîß Features Implemented

- Basic key press & combinations (Win+R, Alt+Tab, etc.)
- String typing
- Script management (save, delete, execute via UI)
- WiFi AP hosting and WebUI

---

## ‚è≥ Work in Progress

- Fixing WiFi conditional execution (`IF_PRESENT`, `IF_NOTPRESENT`)
- Function-style variables
- Cleaning up script parser for unsupported commands

---

## ‚åõ Next Steps

1. Split `index.html` and `syntaxes.json` for cleaner design
2. Define full JSON schema for supported commands
3. Add status indicators in UI for working / not working features
4. Gradually implement missing features (#3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11)

---

## ‚úÖ Usage

1. Flash firmware onto ESP32-S3
2. Connect to WiFi AP
3. Open `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. Upload and run scripts from the WebUI
