# CODE V2 [EARLY_ACCESS] IS THE NEWEST CODE RIGHT NOW! [LINK](https://github.com/QWavey/ESP-32-S3-devkitc-BadUSB/blob/main/codeV2%5BEARLY_ACCESS%5D.cpp)

# EspGuard

---
A proof-of-concept BadUSB project using the ESP32-S3 DevKitC. Demonstrates HID (Human Interface Device) emulation, keystroke injection, and custom payload deployment for security research, red teaming, and penetration testing.
This project provides a web-based control panel for the ESP32-S3 BadUSB.  
It allows uploading, editing, and executing BadUSB scripts directly from a browser over WiFi.

## File Structure:
`/languages` (inside of sd card, containing all Language files, You need to find the Language files yourself. Putting them here in the repository would get me into legal trouble.)
  en.json 
  de.json
  .....

## üóÇÔ∏è Planned File Structure

- `index.html` ‚Üí main frontend (UI for writing & executing scripts)
- `syntaxes.json` ‚Üí list of all available commands (`STRING`, `DELAY`, `REPEAT`, etc.) with description + examples
- `main.cpp` (firmware) ‚Üí ESP32 BadUSB logic
- `README.md` ‚Üí project documentation (this file)
- Folder for payloads `/payloads`
- Folder for Fonts `/fonts`
- Folder for custom Designs / Items such as CSS, JS, HTML. `/items`
- `/languages` (inside of sd card, containing all files)
- `config.json` (inside of the Root of the SD card. Main config for WiFi hosting, password etc  etc....)
- `/uploads` For saving uploaded files

## HELPING ME:

If you want to help me, contact me on Discord and send me your code suggestions: sniper74


## üîß Features Implemented

- Basic key press & combinations (Win+R, Alt+Tab, etc.)
- String typing
- Script management (save, delete, execute via UI)
- WiFi AP hosting and WebUI

---

## ‚è≥ Work in Progress

- Function-style variables
- Cleaning up script parser for unsupported commands
- Wiki. To see the incomplete structure, go to : [Wiki](https://github.com/XQuantumWaveX/ESP-32-S3-devkitc-BadUSB/wiki)
---

## ‚åõ Next Steps

1. Split `index.html` and `syntaxes.json` for cleaner design
2. Define full JSON schema for supported commands
3. Add status indicators in UI for working / not working features
4. Gradually implement missing features 
5. Adding Customisation and Designing
---

## ‚úÖ Usage

1. Flash firmware onto ESP32-S3
2. Connect to WiFi AP
3. Open `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. Upload and run scripts from the WebUI
